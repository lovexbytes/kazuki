// Tools test
// ==========
// `bun test tools.test.ts`. A chat moves twice (A to B to C) while an
// agent's call still runs in A, its MCP requests sent to A's tools. B,
// once its relay is done, ends; A's requests must then reach C, not B:
// C taking the call tells A where the chat is (Handover.far, Tools.went).
